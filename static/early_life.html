            <p> Taylor Alison Swift was born on December 13, 1989, at the Reading Hospital 
                in West Reading, Pennsylvania. Swift's father, Scott Kingsley Swift, is a former 
                stockbroker for Merrill Lynch and her mother, Andrea Gardner Swift, 
                is a former homemaker who previously worked as a mutual fund marketing executive.
                Her younger brother, Austin, is an actor. Taylor Swift was named after singer-songwriter James Taylor,
                and has Scottish and German heritage. Her maternal grandmother, Marjorie Finlay, was 
                an opera singer. Taylor spent her early years on a Christmas tree farm that her father had 
                purchased from one of his clients from work. She attended preschool and kindergarten at Alvernia Montessori School
                before transferring to The Wyndcroft School. The family moved to a rented house in the suburban 
                town of Wyomissing, Pennsylvania, where She attended Wyomissing Area Junior/Senior High School. 
                She spent her summers at the beach in Stone Harbor, New Jersey, and performed in a local coffee shop. </p>

            <p> At age nine, Taylor Swift became interested in musical theater and performed in Four Berks Youth Theatre Academy productions.
                She also traveled regularly to New York City for vocal and acting lessons.  Later, she shifted her focus towards 
                country music, which was inspired by Canadian singer-songwriter, Shania Twain.  Taylor would spend her weekends performing at local festivals and events.
                After watching a documentary about Faith Hill, Swift felt sure she needed to move to Nashville, Tennessee to pursue a career in music. She 
                traveled with her mother at age eleven to visit Nashville record labels and submitted demo tapes of Dolly Parton and The Chicks 
                karaoke covers, but was rejected. </p> 
            
            <p> Taylor Swift was around 12 years old when computer repairman and local musician, Ronnie Cremer, taught her how to play guitar. He helped with her first efforts as a songwriter, leading her 
                to write "Lucky You". In 2003, Swift and her parents started working with New York-based talent manager, Dan Dymtrow. With his help, 
                Swift modeled for Abercrombie & Fitch as part of their "Rising Stars" campaign, had an original song that included on a Maybelline compilation CD,
                and attended meetings with major record labels. After performing original songs at an RCA Records showcase, Swift, then 13 years old, was 
                given an artist development deal and began making frequent trips to Nashville with her mother. To help Swift enter into the country 
                music scene, her father transferred to Merrill Lynch's Nashville office when she was 14 years old, and the family relocated to Hendersonville, 
                Tennessee. Swift initially attended Hendersonville High School before transferring to the Aaron Academy after two years, which better 
                suited her touring schedule through homeschooling. She graduated one year early. </p>
