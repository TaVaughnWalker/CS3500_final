                  <h3>Career Beginnings</h3>
                  <p> Taylor Swift's first single, "Tim Mcgraw", was an immediate success, spending eight months on the Billboard country singles chart.  At age 16, she followed with a self-titled 
            debut album, and she went on tour, opening for Rascal Flatts.  Taylor Swift became certified platinum in 2007, having sold more than one million copies 
            in the United States. Taylor continued a rigorous touring schedule, opening for artists such as George Strait, Kenny Chesney, Tim McGraw, and 
            Faith Hill. That November, she received the Horizon Award for best new artist from the Country Music Association (CMA), ending the year in which 
            she emerged as country music’s most-visible young star. </p>
            
                  
                  <p> On Swift’s second album, Fearless, she demonstrated a refined pop sensibility, managing to court the mainstream pop audience without losing sight of her 
            country roots.  Fearless opened at number one on the Billboard 200 chart with sales that had more than half a million copies in its first week. It ultimately spent more 
            time on top of the chart than any other album released in that decade. Singles such as “You Belong with Me” and “Love Story” were popular in the digital market as well, 
            the latter accounting for more than 4,000,000 paid downloads. </p>
