                  <h3>Reputation, Controversies, and Present Day</h3>
                  
                 <p> In 2016, Taylor Swift’s feud with Kanye West resumed after he released the single “Famous.” The song included a lyric in which Swift was referred to as a “bitch,” and she alleged that it was misogynistic.Their 
            controversy escalated after Kanye’s wife, Kim Kardashian, released a recording of a phone call in which Swift gave her approval for the line, though West made no mention of calling her a bitch. Swift’s 
            controversies continued as she took part in a widely publicized civil trial in August 2017, after former radio host, David Mueller, sued the singer, her mother, and a promoter, claiming that Swift had 
            falsely accused him of sexually groping her in 2013 during the taking of a photograph and thus destroyed his career. Taylor countersued, maintaining that the assault had taken place. At the trial, Swift 
            was removed from Mueller’s suit and the other two defendants were found not liable as the jury found in favour of Swift’s countersuit. Shortly thereafter, Swift released the hit song “Look What You Made 
            Me Do,” and her album Reputation became the top-selling American LP of 2017. </p>
        
                 <p> In 2019, Taylor Swift released her seventh album, Lover, in which she described it as “a love letter to love itself.” That year, she also appeared in the musical, Cats, a film adaptation by Andrew Lloyd Webber.
            In 2020, a documentary about her life and career was made, which was called Miss Americana. With little advance notice, she released Folklore in the same year. A departure from her previous pop-inspired work,
            Swift’s eighth studio album drew praise for its introspection and restraint, and it also won the Grammy for album of the year. Her next record, Evermore, appeared later in 2020. Swift adopted a synth-pop 
           sound for the candid Midnights released in 2022, which she described as “the story of 13 sleepless nights scattered throughout my life.”  Throughout her life, Taylor Swift has been through hardship, trials and 
        tribulations but her resilience and determination allowed her to become the singer-songwriter she is today. </p>
