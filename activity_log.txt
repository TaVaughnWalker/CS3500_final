Jadon, Zufall [Mar 17 2023]:
	Creation of github repo as well as basic project template.  This is a seperate github repo from the one
	that was used for the first project.

Jadon, Zufall [Mar 17 2023]:
	Included JQuery Bootstrap and PHP into the website by linking the index.html, Possibly make this into a PHP
	include file so that it can be included in a single line later down the line.

Jadon, Zufall [Mar 17 2023]:
	Created basic outline for the global CSS style sheet that will be used throughout the webpage in order to
	keep the sites theme consistant.

Jadon, Zufall [Mar 18 2023]:
	Create documentation for github repo in the readme file, this includes installation instructions for all the
	required parts of the tech stack that require an install such as Git MySQL XAMPP and PHP on three operating
	systems each (Windows, Mac, Linux).  I also am planning on updating this to include project setup instructions
	for reference as setting up a web development enviorment on a local machine can be a bit tricky at times.  This
	also includes the project requirements as well as documentation of the file structure and how to properly create
	pages that kind of thing.

Jadon, Zufall [Mar 18 2023]:
	Created dbh.inc.php an include file that will be used in order to read and write data to the database.  Basically
	this PHP file connects to the database and is intended to be accessed else where.

Jadon, Zufall [Mar 18 2023]:
	Started work on some PHP tools such as a signup page as well as a login page, this will be used later on for user
	auth but I just wanted to get some PHP stuff into the website.  Currently the form is not secure and will need some
	work before it will be secure but that comes with a bit of time.

Jadon, Zufall [Mar 18 2023]:
	Created database schema for user accounts table, this will store the user accounts although the current state of
	the table is not final as passwords will require hashing and other web security stuff.

Jadon, Zufall [Mar 18 2023]:
	Added documentation to readme.md on properly using github from a local machine rather then from the webpage as
	I think that people have been using as this will make it much easier to host on a webserver etc.

Jadon, Zufall [Mar 18 2023]:
	Created header.php in order to include in other files elsewhere so that things are easily added across webpages and
	are not required to be included elsewhere over and over again.
